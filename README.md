# Project Sokoban Game Development

This project involves the development of a Sokoban-style puzzle game as part of the Object-Oriented Software Engineering course. The main objective is to design and implement a Java application that allows players to move a guardian to push boxes onto designated target positions within a warehouse.

The development process follows a structured approach, starting with UML modeling to design the game's basic business logic. The Java code is written according to the UML model, then further developed to ensure a complexer functional version of the game. A controller class is implemented to handle game logic, ensuring that user actions follow defined movement rules.

Once the first version is operational, the project extends to integrating a graphical user interface (GUI). In this approach, i used an existing GUI framework, leveraging Java's graphical libraries. The implementation adheres to good software design principles, including MVC architecture, encapsulation, and modularity, ensuring a clean and maintainable structure.
